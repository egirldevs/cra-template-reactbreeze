# React is a breeze with Tailwind.
`Reactbreeze` is a CRA (create-react-app) template based on [Reactinnit](https://github.com/DanningtonSystems/cra-template-reactinnit). Reactbreeze contains a Tailwind-based template built on top of the Reactinnit structure, which is a more organized version of the default CRA template.

## Usage

To use Reactinnit with Yarn, use a command like the following:

`yarn create react-app [application name or . for current directory] --template reactbreeze`

With NPM, you can use:

`npx create-react-app [application name or . for current directory] --template reactbreeze`
