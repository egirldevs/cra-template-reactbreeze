<!--
  This is the template page that React uses to render the application. Add fonts, standard scripts and styles, and more of the like here.
  However, you shuld always use React to add code and styles when possible. You shouldn't have to use this file to do as such in most cases.

  This file includes viewport settings, theme colour configurations (set to Reactbreeze's branding colour by default), met tags, and the
  actual container where the application is rendered (see div with ID "root").
